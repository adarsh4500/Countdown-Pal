# Countdown Pal Backend

This is the backend for the Countdown Pal application. It is a simple Go web server that serves the data for the frontend.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://go.dev/dl/.

Once you have Go installed, you can clone the repository and run the server using the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the server on port 8080. You can access the API endpoints by making HTTP requests to the server.
